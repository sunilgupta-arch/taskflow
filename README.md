## ⚙️ Business Rules

1. **Only CLIENT organization** can create tasks
2. **LOCAL team cannot create tasks**
3. If a task is unassigned, **LOCAL_USER** can self-assign ("pick")
4. When a task is completed **with a reward amount**, an entry is auto-created in `rewards_ledger`
5. Rewards must be **manually marked as paid** by LOCAL_ADMIN
6. Tasks are **soft-deleted** (never permanently removed)
7. Attendance is **auto-logged on login**
8. **Cron jobs** regenerate daily/weekly recurring tasks automatically

## 🔄 Cron Jobs

| Job | Schedule | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| Daily Task Regen | Midnight daily | Recreates completed daily tasks |
| Weekly Task Regen | Midnight Monday | Recreates completed weekly tasks |
| Attendance Cleanup | 11:59 PM daily | Sets logout time for open sessions |
